# Next-Word-Prediction-Shiny-App
The goal of this project was to create an app to highlight the prediction algorithm that was built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project it was submitted:

1. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word. It was posted on Shiny server:
